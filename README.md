My favorite programming language is probably C++, although it's been changing a lot recently. It's my current favorite because I used it in fall quarter for CSE100 and it's very fast when used properly, although I suspect with my taking of CSE150B and CSE156, it'll switch back to python, which is much better for AI and deep learning.
